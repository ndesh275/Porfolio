                    <p>
                        I'm sitting at home, in the heart of Kiambu, having a cup of coffee, tapping away at my laptop while it rains outside. 
                        In a few years I will walk into my first job as a front-end developer. 
                        2 months ago I was just a student at Baricho High School who knew nothing about programming, and now I'm here. How did this happen?”
                        Come along with me as I share with you my journey of how I got here.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Feeling Special</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I first started thinking about becoming a developer, 
                        I would read articles like this one with a bit of skepticism. 
                        I kept on looking for something in the writer's background that made them “special”. 
                        That made them suited for this course. Something that I knew I didn't have.
                        I have since come to understand that this is not how it works. 
                        There aren't any “special” requirements to becoming a developer. 
                        I'm not going to tell you it's easy, because it isn't. 
                        But the good news is that all the requirements are things that are in everyone's reach. 
                        You have to be willing to work hard, learn a lot, and be consistent. 
                        You need to persist when things get tough. Talk yourself out of the moments of desperation when you feel like you are not cut out for this. 
                        That's all it takes, and everyone can do these things with a bit of practice.
                        I started with no related background study. I had no money to spend on expensive courses, But thanks to God, I was among the Students sponsored 
                        from our the High School To go and study In Zaleogo academy.
                        In my Mind, I knew That Everyone's circumstances were different, but I learned that if you put your mind to it, you can do it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>One True Path To Success</h3>
                    <p>
                        This clearly doesn't exist. Two of us started around the same time learning to code for a career change: 
                        myself and a good friend of mine. The two of us are now working in the field, 
                        and there is very little in common between our approaches. Each one followed the material and methods that worked for them. 
                        If there is one thing in common between us, it is that we simply did not give up, and kept on going. We all put a lot of hard work and persistence.
                        So instead of the one true path, I'm going to tell you a bit about my path. It's not the only way, it is not the best way. It is what worked for me.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, before i started attending my classes at Zalego Academy, I started reading about Web Development then i started
                         watching YouTube videos about programming to understand where to begin. 
                         Then I started playing around with HTML and CSS. I followed tutorials and coded along to build some basic web pages. 
                         This made me see that it was something I really wanted to get into.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        I knew that the only way forward was to study for it. I had full-time studying timetable for school, so waiting until “I had time” was never an option. 
                        I had to do it while still revising my school work and doing assignments, or not at all. 
                        I was lucky that my friend was learning at the same time. 
                        This helped us organize our days to maximize learning time.
                        Then as April approached, seeing my deadline looming closer, I rallied again and got organized. 
                        I started pushing through, putting in those hours no matter how tired I was and how little time I had.
                        Sometimes I would get up early to code, sometimes I would stay up late.
                        This meant that my life was pretty much reduced to doing the work at school that i was dedicated also to do  
                        And I basically maintained that rhythm all the way until the day I started coding without refering anywhere. 
                        That was in the end of March, several weeks before my deadline.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Courses</h3>
                    <p>
                        What I believe is that Courses can only take you so far, so I complemented this with other tools to help me learn and 
                        in the future get a job.
                          <br> <span style="color: #dc143c;"> GitHub:</span> an important tool to learn, and where I host all my projects for free. And I soon came to realise that 
                            It's usually the first place employers look to see your work.
                         <br> <span style="color: #dc143c;">Portfolio:</span> I learned the most vital development skills by building it and other self-initiated projects.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Getting a new Job</h3>
                    <p>
                        And so, on that rainy day at home, after finishing my coffee. I slept and dreamt that  
                        I walked into an office in the business area, introduced myself as the new front-end developer, and started my new career.Which i believe will soon become True.
                    </p>
                    <h3>End Of Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        I hope you enjoyed my story. If you did, you would make me happy if you give it some of those tasty claps.
                    </p>

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p> I as a HTML developer, am responsible for the complete end-to-end coding of websites.
                    I direct HTML projects, develop web applications, code sites, and 
                        provide support to website users.</p>
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends and I had been 
                        building a website about our favorite Movie shows. 
                        Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common 
                        aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. 
                        I learned how to use CSS so I could 
                        bring the pages into harmony without writing new HTML tags for each page.”

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                         JavaScript is a core technology enabling websites to interact with visitors and perform complex actions. 
                        There are a number of different places where JavaScript can be used but my main focus is in web development.
                        I use it while creating webpages to make some features active.
                    </p>

                    <h3>PHP</h3>
                    <p>
                        PHP is highly appreciated and widely used web programming and scripting language that helps empower 
                         websites through its extensive and remarkable plug and play characteristics.
